# OMMC-Bot
Do you want some fun math practice before AMC’s, but don’t always have the time to do a full mock? Then try OMMC’s first ever Problem Of The Day (POTD) Season, using our own original high quality problems written by experienced problem writers.

We will be hosting the OMMC POTD season on the Discord server: https://discord.com/invite/4WejYWbtvh. To participate, join it: we have a ton of high quality materials and events, and it’s a great way to show your support for our cause!

**POTD will be held from Monday October 9th to Sunday October 29th. One problem each day. We already have a test problem there, it'll be great if you can submit it to test out the functionality**
